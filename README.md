Disclaimer: This is a very old project from 2018, so apologies for the hard-to-read code. I have no plans to modify or optimise, however thought I would upload the code since it was an interesting project.. and works well despite the sub-optimal code.

The files both have customizable variables at the start of the code that can be altered depending on your preference of keycap size, shape or text. These can then be used to 3d print your own keycaps!
